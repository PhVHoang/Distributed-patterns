In the adapter pattern, the adapter container is used to modify the interface of the application container so that it conforms to some predefined interface that is expected of all applications. For example,
an adapter might ensure that an application implements a consistent monitoring interface. Or it might ensure that log files are always written to stdout or any number
of other conventions.
